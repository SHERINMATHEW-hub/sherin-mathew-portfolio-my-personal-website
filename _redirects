# --- Custom Redirects and Rewrites for Netlify ---

# 1. Custom 404 Page (Must be before the SPA rewrite)
# If a URL doesn't match any existing file or other redirect rules,
# Netlify will serve your custom 404.html page.
# Make sure you have a `404.html` file in your site's root directory.
/404 /404.html 404

# 2. Force WWW or non-WWW (Optional, for SEO consistency)
# Choose ONE of the options below and uncomment it if you want to
# enforce a consistent domain (e.g., always `www.yourdomain.com`).
# Netlify often handles HTTPS and WWW/non-WWW automatically,
# but these explicit rules ensure it.

# OPTION A: Force WWW (e.g., example.com -> www.example.com)
# Uncomment the following three lines if you want this:
# https://example.com/* https://www.example.com/:splat 301!
# http://example.com/* https://www.example.com/:splat 301!
# http://www.example.com/* https://www.example.com/:splat 301!

# OPTION B: Force non-WWW (e.g., www.example.com -> example.com)
# Uncomment the following three lines if you want this:
# https://www.example.com/* https://example.com/:splat 301!
# http://www.example.com/* https://example.com/:splat 301!
# http://example.com/* https://example.com/:splat 301!

# Remember to replace `example.com` with your actual domain name!

# 3. Specific Permanent Redirects (for future, if you rename pages)
# If you ever change the URL of a section or page, add a 301 redirect here
# to ensure old links still work and search engines update their index.
# Example:
# /old-about /#about 301
# /old-contact /#contact 301
# /my-legacy-project /#projects 301


# 4. SPA / Catch-all Rewrite (Your original rule, but positioned last)
# This rule tells Netlify that if a user navigates to a path that isn't a
# specific file or a redirect defined above, it should serve `index.html`.
# This is crucial for single-page applications where client-side JavaScript
# handles routing to different sections based on the URL path.
# This prevents 404 errors for internal SPA routes (e.g., yourdomain.com/#about).
