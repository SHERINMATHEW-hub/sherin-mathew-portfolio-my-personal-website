# --- Custom Headers ---
# Recommended for improving security, SEO, and performance.
# These are applied globally unless specified otherwise.

# Security Headers for all pages
[[headers]]
  for = "/*" # Apply to all paths
  [headers.values]
    # Protects against clickjacking attacks. "DENY" prevents embedding in an iframe.
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    # Basic protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    # Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared Content-Type.
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    # Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests.
    # "no-referrer-when-downgrade" is a good balance for privacy and functionality.

    # Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) ensures that the browser only connects
    # to your site using HTTPS. Requires your site to be served over HTTPS.
    # max-age: How long (in seconds) the browser should remember to use HTTPS. (1 year = 31536000)

# Caching Headers for Assets (CSS, JS, fonts)
# This tells browsers to aggressively cache these files, improving load times for returning visitors.
[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*" # Apply to everything in the /assets/ folder
  [headers.values]
    # Cache for 1 year, public means it can be cached by proxies, immutable means content won't change

# --- Netlify Forms Configuration (Optional: Add a honeypot for spam) ---
# This section can be used to configure form settings.
# A honeypot field is a common way to deter spam bots.
# If you enable this, you need to add a hidden input field to your HTML form.
[forms]
  # Configure a honeypot field. The value here should be the 'name' attribute
  # of a hidden input field you add to your HTML form.
  honeypot = "bot-field"
  # Example HTML for the honeypot field (add inside your <form> tag):
  # <input type="text" name="bot-field" style="display: none; position: absolute; left: -9999px;">

# --- Redirects (Optional: Only if you want to move all redirects from _redirects file) ---
# You are currently using a `_redirects` file, which is perfectly fine.
# If you prefer to manage ALL redirects in netlify.toml instead, you can uncomment this
# section and move your rules here. However, it's generally best to stick to one method.
# Since you have `_redirects` in place, it's advised to keep your redirects there for consistency.
# Example if you wanted to move your `/* /index.html 200` rule here:
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/*"
#   to = "/index.html"
#   status = 200
# Example for 404:
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/404"
#   to = "/404.html"
#   status = 404
